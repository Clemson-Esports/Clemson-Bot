Contributing and Development
============================
This is a quick guide on how to develop and contribute to this project!

## 1. Dependencies
Make sure you can run these commands and install them if not present.
* npm - Node Package Manager, included with Node.js
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) from Node.js


## 2. Get a Discord bot token
* Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications
    * Log in if needed
* Create an Application
    * Your bot's name will show up as what you name it here.
* Click "Bot" on the left sidebar
* Click "Add Bot" and confirm
* Make note of the token on this page (later refered to as BotToken)


## 3. Join the Test Server
[Click here to join the server](https://discord.gg/3GkAQEC)
ping @Zerukai#4327 for permissions to add bots


## 4. Prepare bot for connecting to discord server
* Click "OAuth2" in the left sidebar
* In the "scopes" section, check `bot`
* In the "bot permissions" section, check the following boxes [![perms](https://i.postimg.cc/NFkdvDCY/perms.png)](https://postimg.cc/xNqvKvSF)
* Copy the link from the "scopes" section and open in a new tab/window
* Select the test server to add the bot to

## 5. Prepare the Repo
* Fork this repo
* `git clone` your fork to wherever you want to work on this bot
* Copy `BotSecrets.json.template` and rename that copy to `BotSecrets.json`
* Copy/paste the token from the Discord page into the `BotToken` empty string
* Create a database name (Whatever you want it doesnt matter)
* Set a custom bot prefix that will invoke your commands 


## 6. Setting up the build environment
Setup a virtual environment:  
`pip3 install virtualenv` windows: `py -m pip install --user virtualenv`

`virtualenv venv`  windows: `py -m venv env`

Enter the virtualenv with:  
`source venv/bin/activate` windows: `source .\env\Scripts\activate`

Then allow pip to get the latest libraries:  
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` windows: `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can then test-run the bot with the command:  
`python3 -m bot`  windows: `py -m bot`
when you are in the root directory `ClemBot/`

The bot should show up in the test server and respond to commands (test with `<your_prefix>hello`)
