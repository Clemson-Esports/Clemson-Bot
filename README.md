Contributing and Development
============================
This is a quick guide on how to develop and contribute to this project!
*Thank you to the [Clemson CPSC Discord Bot Devs](https://github.com/ClemsonCPSC-Discord/ClemBot) for letting us use their contributing guide!*

## 1. Dependencies
Make sure that you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. 
You can check to make sure it's installed by running either of the following commands via command line...

* `npm` - Node Package Manager, included with Node.js
* `node` - from Node.js

If these commands don't give you an error, then you can continue to the next step.

## 2. Get a Discord Bot Token

* Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)
  * Log in with your Discord account information
* Create an Application
  * `New Application` button in the top right corner
  * The name of your bot will show up as what you name it here
* Click `Bot` on the left sidebar
* Click `Add Bot` and confirm
* Make note of the token on this page


## 3. Join the Test Server

* Click the link for the an invite to the [Test Server](https://discord.gg/3GkAQEC)
* Message `Zerukai#4327` for a Developer role
* Create a text channel with your name where you can test your commands in the `Test Bots` category


## 4. Prepare Bot for Connecting to the Test Server

* Click `OAuth2` in the left sidebar
* In the `SCOPES` section, check `bot`
* In the `BOT PERMISSIONS` section, check `Administrator`
* Copy the link from the `SCOPES` section and open in a new tab/window
* Select the test server to add the bot to (or send the link to `Zerukai#4327` if you don't have permissions)
* Check to see if your bot is in the serverlist

## 5. Preparing the Repository

* Fork this repository
* `git clone` your fork to wherever you want to work on this bot
* Rename `config.json.template` to `config.json` and fill out the values inside
  * `token` is what you created in part 2
  * `prefix` is the prefix for each of your commands. 
    * By convention we have our first and last initial followed by an exclamation point.
    * Ex: `mh!` ‚û° `mh! <command>`
  * `owner` is your Discord ID. Find it [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).


## 6. Setting up the Build Environment

Download all of the required node packages:

* `npm install`

You can then test-run the bot with the command:  

* `node bot.js`

when you are in the root directory `\Clemson-Bot`

## 7. Developing and Testing your first Command

Navigate to the `Clemson-Bot/commands/templates/` folder and find the `templateCommand.js` file.
This file gives you a template of how you can create a command, simply edit and add to it to create your own command.
You can find examples of other commands already written in the `Clemson-Bot/commands/*` folders.

The bot should show up in the test server and respond to commands (test with `<your_prefix><command>`)

* Ex: `cu! templateCommand` will have the bot return back `Hello World!`
